    $ node -v
    $ nvm install 16.19.0
    $ yarn <or> npm install
```

* After node modules install for the first time, there will be an error in the `scss` file of `node_modules`, you can fix it as follows
* you can skip the below command if you aren't installing the `node_modules`
```bash
    $ vim node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_function.scss
```

* the above command will open an editor, where you will have to put percentage sign `%` at line `195` after the digit `100`, => it should be `100%`

* After that you can save the file by pressing `Esc`, and then `:wq` to write and quit
